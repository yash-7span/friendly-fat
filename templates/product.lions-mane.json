            "section_text": "<p>MCT stands for Medium Chain Triglycerides which are fatty acids derived mainly from coconut oil. MCT’s are shorter in lenght than most other fats and therefore takes a shortcut in the body.\n\nBecause of this, the body can turn MCT into energy far more quickly and through a totally different pathway, compared to other types of fats.\n\nKetones are a powerful fuel for your body that will instantly improve energy, increase fat burn, reduce cravings and improve your mental performance and focus.\n\nMCT’s are often used by athletes who needs instant and sustained energy to boost their performance and improve endurance during a tough workout. MCT’s are also very helpful for weight loss, assisting to keep blood sugar levels stable and control appetite by increasing the feeling of fullness. MCT-oil also improves gut health and reduces inflammation.<\/p>"

It's a powerful superfood  that feeds our healthy gut bacteria and supports your body's digestive health, which is the foundation of a healthy body.\n\nAcacia fiber is great to include in your diet for many everyday health benefits. Especially to promote a healthy microbiome\n\nYour microbiome (gut bacteria) is the trillions of live bacteria living in your body and these organisms are crucial to our overall health. Researcher are starting to understand just how much of our health is starting in the gut and how important it is to keep it healthy and flourishing.\n\nOur Microbiome can be compared to a garden where the beautiful flowers are the good bacteria and the weed is the bad bacteria. To stay healthy we need to grow the flowers and minimize the weed. To grow our healthy bacterias in the gut we need to give them plenty of nourishing food (prebiotics=soluble fibers) and Acacia fiber is the holy grail of prebiotics.<\/p>"
