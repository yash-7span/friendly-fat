The composition looks like this:\n\n- Caproic acid (C6): <3%\n- Caprylic Acid (C8): 6%\n- Capric Acid (C10): 9%\n- Lauric Acid (C12): +50%\n\nWe have extracted C8 (caprylic acid) because it's the most powerful fatty acid because if its quick absorption and instantly converts to energy. There are 6% C8 MCT in coconut oil compared to 100% C8 in the MCT-oil we use.<\/p>"
